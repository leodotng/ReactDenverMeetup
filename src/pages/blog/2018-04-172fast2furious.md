Heroic Refactoring for Mortals by Dan Levy

Learn a superhuman refactoring technique designed for us mortals. Dan will demonstrate how the right mix of Functional Programming in JavaScript can & will make your development life easier. None of the typical jargon will be necessary.

This talk will be especially valuable if you have ever had to refactor someone else's code, and had no idea what the author was thinking (or what your boss *actually* wants when asked to refactor).

Honestly, who remembers what their own code was doing after only a few weeks away from it? Might as well have been coded by stranger!

By the end of this talk:

You will know how to break apart any unwieldy code into manageable & testable parts.
Apply the concepts to peer/code review for high-value feedback.
Profit!

While the demo will be in JavaScript, the techniques will be applicable in almost any language. (I'm a NodeJS team guy so I gotta support the home team).

Dan Levy is a Lead Instructor at Galvanize and contributor to multiple Open Source Software projects such as NodeJS, Docker, Lodash, Rancher, Minio, and more.
